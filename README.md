# 🔐 FILE ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION – EncryptEase
EncryptEase is a standalone desktop application that implements secure file encryption and decryption using AES-GCM and ChaCha20, with RSA-based key wrapping and SHA-256 integrity verification. It features authenticated access, a modular architecture, performance analysis, and a Tkinter-based GUI, operating fully offline.

## Project Overview
EncryptEase enables users to securely encrypt and decrypt files using industry-standard cryptographic algorithms. RSA is used to securely wrap symmetric keys, while SHA-256 ensures file integrity.The system also includes user authentication, performance analysis, and automatic report generation through an intuitive graphical interface.
